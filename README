NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::KENTNL::Lite - A Minimal Build-Only
    replacement for @KENTNL for contributors.

VERSION
    version 0.01000002

SYNOPSIS
        -[@KENTNL]
        +[@KENTNL::Lite]

        dzil build
        dzil test
        dzil release # BANG.

DESCRIPTION
    This is an attempt at one way of solving a common problem when
    contributing to things built with "Dist::Zilla".

    This is done by assuming that the code base that its targeting will
    NEVER be released in its built form, but close enough to the normal
    build method that it's suitable for testing and contributing.

    *   Less install time dependencies

    *   More phases in the "PluginBundle" generation are 'optional'

    *   Less points of failure

    Good examples of things I've experienced in this category are the 2
    following ( But awesome ) plug-ins that I use everywhere.

  The "::Git" Plug-ins
    These plug-ins are great, don't get me wrong, but they pose a barrier
    for people on Win32, and in fact, anyone without a copy of Git
    installed, ( Its hard enough getting a copy of the pre-release source
    without Git, but that's available in "tar.gz" and ".zip" on "github" ).

    Working Copies of Git plug-ins are also nonessential if you're not
    building releases.

  The "::Twitter" Plug-in
    Also, a handy plug-in to have, but you're not going to be needing it
    unless you're tweeting a release, and usually, that means you're me.

    Some of its dependencies have been known to fail tests on Windows
    platforms, and thus block automatic installation, so seeing you don't
    have any use for this, its sensible to leave it out.

METHODS
  bundle_config
    See the "PluginBundle" role for what this is for, it is a method to
    satisfy that role.
